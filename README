Dancer-CommandLine

Very simple little helper that simulates parts of Dancer (e.g. warning, debug)
without actually loading anything from Dancer. 

I am not at all sure that this is the way to go. Maybe it would be better to 
load parts of Dancer instead of duplicating the stuff. It would certainly be 
more elegant. For now, it does what i need. See module for more on the 
rationale or use case I am interested in.
